## Introduction

In this project, we utilize clustering analysis techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, total sales, and ratings. By identifying distinct customer segments, we can develop targeted marketing strategies to improve customer engagement and satisfaction.

The customer dataset used for this project contains the following features:

1. Invoice ID: The unique identifier for each invoice.
2. Branch: The branch where the purchase was made.
3. City: The city where the branch is located.
4. Customer type: The type of customer, whether they are a member or a normal customer.
5. Gender: The gender of the customer.
6. Product line: The category of the purchased product.
7. Unit price: The price of a single unit of the product.
8. Quantity: The quantity of the product purchased.
9. Tax 5%: The tax amount applied to the purchase.
10. Total: The total amount of the purchase.
11. Date: The date of the purchase.
12. Time: The time of the purchase.
13. Payment: The payment method used.
14. COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): The cost of the goods sold.
15. Gross margin percentage: The gross margin percentage.
16. Gross income: The gross income from the purchase.
17. Rating: The customer's rating of the purchase experience.
